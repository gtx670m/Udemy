        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric
            dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.[24][25][26] Earth's gravity interacts
            with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves
            around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis
            about 366.26 times.</p>

                <h3>Formation</h3>
                <p>The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5672±0.0006 billion years ago (Bya).[51] By 4.54±0.04
                    Bya[52] the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun.
                    In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which
                    begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with
                    the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular
                    theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth taking 10–20 million years (Mys)
                    to form.[53]</p>

                <p>
                    Hoodoos at the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.
                    Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids,
                    protoplanets, and comets.[58] In this model, atmospheric "greenhouse gases" kept the oceans from freezing
                    when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[59] By 3.5 Bya, Earth's magnetic field
                    was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[60]</p>

                <h3>Origin of life and evolution</h3>
                <p>Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion
                    years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.</p>
